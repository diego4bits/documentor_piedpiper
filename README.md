# DocuMentor

## Installation

1. Create a secret in your GitHub repository named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for generating documentation for your code.

2. Enable `ACTIONS` to make changes to your repository. You can configure this in your repository settings.

3. Add the `deploy_docu.yml` file to your workflows. You can find this YAML file in the DocuMentor repository.

4. Configure the `deploy_docu.yml` workflow to specify when the documentation process should run. By default, it uses `workflow_dispatch`, allowing you to trigger it manually.

5. Create a `.docignore` file and list, line by line, the names of files or folders that DocuMentor should ignore. Even if itâ€™s empty, you must create this file.

6. When DocuMentor runs for the first time, enable GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch to display the generated documentation.

7. Enjoy a well-organized and beautifully updated documentation!

### **IMPORTANT**
- Do not delete the `docs` folder or the `doc.log` file. These are critical for tracking the documentation history.
- If the `doc.log` file is missing, DocuMentor will treat the execution as if it's the first run and document everything.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using DocuMentor, ensure the following:

1. You have a valid OpenAI API key.
2. GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository.
3. You have administrative rights to configure GitHub workflows and GitHub Pages.

### Quick Setup

1. **Set Up Your Repository**  
   - Add your OpenAI API key as a secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your GitHub repository settings.  
   - Enable write permissions for `ACTIONS` under repository settings.

2. **Add DocuMentor Workflow**  
   - Download the `deploy_docu.yml` file from the DocuMentor repository and place it in your `.github/workflows` folder.

3. **Ignore Files**  
   - Create a `.docignore` file in the root of your repository. List any files or directories you want to exclude from documentation. Even if you have no exclusions, this file must exist.

4. **Deploy GitHub Pages**  
   - Run the workflow manually for the first time by triggering it via `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Go to your repository settings and enable GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` branch to display the documentation.

5. **Update Documentation**  
   - Each time the workflow runs, your documentation will be updated automatically based on your latest changes.
