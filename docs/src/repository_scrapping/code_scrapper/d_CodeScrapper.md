## `CodeScrapper`

#### Description:
This class represents a code scrapper and provides functionalities for extracting code snippets from files.

#### Attributes:
- `_input_file` (`FileHandler`): An instance of the `FileHandler` class that is used to handle input files. Default: `None`.
- `_file_dependencies` (`DependenciesInfo`): An instance of the `DependenciesInfo` class that is used to store information about file dependencies. Default: `None`.
- `_snippet_storage` (`SnippetStorage`): An instance of the `SnippetStorage` class that is used to store code snippets. Default: An empty instance of `SnippetStorage`.
- `_parser` (`Parser`): An instance of the `Parser` class that is used to parse code files. Default: An empty instance of `Parser`.
- `_relevant_nodes_names` (`Set[str]`): A set of relevant node names that are used for code snippet extraction. Default: `None`.
- `_assignment_nodes_names` (`Set[str]`): A set of assignment node names that are used for code snippet extraction. Default: `None`.
- `_ast_root` (`Node`): The root node of the abstract syntax tree. Default: `None`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = CodeScrapper()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `CodeScrapper` class is used for extracting code snippets from files. It uses a `FileHandler` instance to handle input files, a `DependenciesInfo` instance to store information about file dependencies, a `SnippetStorage` instance to store code snippets, and a `Parser` instance to parse code files. The class also maintains sets of relevant node names and assignment node names for code snippet extraction.

#### Dependencies:
- `FileHandler`: This class is used to handle input files.
- `DependenciesInfo`: This class is used to store information about file dependencies.
- `SnippetStorage`: This class is used to store code snippets.
- `Parser`: This class is used to parse code files.
