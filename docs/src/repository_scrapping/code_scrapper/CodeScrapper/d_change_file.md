## `change_file(file: FileHandler) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method updates the input file of the CodeScrapper object and updates the scrapper accordingly. This method belongs to the class CodeScrapper.

#### Parameters:
- `file` (`FileHandler`): The new input file to be used by the CodeScrapper object.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns True if the file was successfully changed.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
scrapper = CodeScrapper()
file = FileHandler("path/to/file")
result_case1 = scrapper.change_file(file)
print(result_case1) # Output: True

# Another use case (if applicable)
file2 = FileHandler("path/to/another_file")
result_case2 = scrapper.change_file(file2)
print(result_case2) # Output: True
```

#### How it Works:
This method takes a FileHandler object as a parameter and sets it as the new input file for the CodeScrapper object. Then, it calls the _update_scrapper() method to update the scrapper accordingly. Finally, it returns True to indicate that the file was successfully changed.

#### Dependencies:
- `FileHandler`: Represents a file and provides methods to read and manipulate its contents.
