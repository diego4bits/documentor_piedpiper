## `storage_dict() -> Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`

#### Description:
This method returns a dictionary containing the stored code snippets. It belongs to the class `CodeScrapper`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
- `Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`: A dictionary where the keys are integers representing the snippet IDs and the values are instances of the `CodeSnippet` class representing the stored code snippets.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:
```python
# Example 1: Retrieving the stored code snippets
snippet_dict = code_scrapper.storage_dict()
print(snippet_dict)

# Example 2: Iterating over the stored code snippets
for snippet_id, snippet in snippet_dict.items():
    print(f"Snippet ID: {snippet_id}")
    print(f"Snippet Code: {snippet.code}")
    print(f"Snippet Language: {snippet.language}")
```

#### How it Works:
The method `storage_dict` returns the internal storage dictionary of the `CodeScrapper` class, which contains the stored code snippets. The dictionary is accessed through the `_snippet_storage` attribute of the `CodeScrapper` instance.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet with its associated information.
