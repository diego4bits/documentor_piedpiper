## `_scrape_assignment() -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs the scraping of assignment nodes from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a code file. It belongs to the class `CodeScrapper` and is used to extract code snippets and save them.

#### Parameters:
This method does not have any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return anything (`None`).

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
scraper = CodeScrapper()
scraper._scrape_assignment()
```

#### How it Works:
1. Retrieve the assignment nodes from the AST of the code file using the `get_nodes()` method from the `tree_sitter_logic.tree_sitter_util` module.
2. Iterate over each assignment node.
3. Create a `SnippetExtract` object using the node information and the content of the code file.
4. Create a `CodeSnippet` object using the `SnippetExtract`, the input file, and the file dependencies.
5. Save the `CodeSnippet` object using the `_save_code_snippet()` method.

#### Dependencies:
- `get_nodes()`: A function from the `tree_sitter_logic.tree_sitter_util` module that is used to retrieve nodes from the AST.
- `SnippetExtract`: A class from the `snippet_management.snippet_extract` module that is used to extract code snippets from the code file.
- `CodeSnippet`: A class from the `snippet_management.code_snippet` module that represents a code snippet.
- `_save_code_snippet()`: A method from the `CodeScrapper` class that is used to save the code snippet.
