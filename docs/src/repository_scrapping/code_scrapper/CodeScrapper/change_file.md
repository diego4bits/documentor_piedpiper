## `change_file(file: FileHandler) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method updates the input file of the CodeScrapper object and updates the scrapper accordingly. This method belongs to the class CodeScrapper.

#### Parameters:
- `file` (`FileHandler`): The new input file to be set for the CodeScrapper object.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: True if the input file was successfully changed.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
file = FileHandler("path/to/file")
result_case1 = code_scrapper.change_file(file)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
file2 = FileHandler("path/to/another_file")
result_case2 = code_scrapper.change_file(file2)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method takes a `FileHandler` object as input and sets it as the new input file for the CodeScrapper object. It then calls the `_update_scrapper()` method to update the scrapper accordingly. Finally, it returns True to indicate that the input file was successfully changed.

#### Dependencies:
- `FileHandler`: A class that handles file operations. The `change_file` method relies on this class to set the new input file.
