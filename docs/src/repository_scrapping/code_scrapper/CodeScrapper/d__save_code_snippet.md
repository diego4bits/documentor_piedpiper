## `_save_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> None`

#### Description:
This method saves a code snippet to the snippet storage. It belongs to the class `CodeScrapper`.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet object to be saved.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return anything.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Creating a code snippet object
code = "print('Hello, World!')"
language = "python"
file_extension = ".py"
dependencies = {"sys": "library"}
snippet = CodeSnippet(code, language, file_extension, dependencies)

# Saving the code snippet
code_scrapper = CodeScrapper()
code_scrapper._save_code_snippet(snippet)
```
