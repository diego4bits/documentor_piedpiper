## `_valid_file(sys_path: Path) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method checks whether a file is valid or should be ignored. It is used for filtering out files that should not be processed. This method belongs to the class `FileScrapper`.

#### Parameters:
- `sys_path` (`Path`): The path to the file that needs to be checked.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the file is valid and should not be ignored, otherwise returns `False`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Check if a file is valid
is_valid = _valid_file(sys_path)
if is_valid:
    print("The file is valid and should not be ignored.")
else:
    print("The file is not valid and should be ignored.")
```

#### How it Works:
- The method splits the system path (`sys_path`) into individual path names using the backslash character as the separator.
- It checks if any of the path names in the `divide_path` list are present in the `_ignore` list, which contains the paths to be ignored. If any match is found, the file is considered invalid and should be ignored.
- It also checks if the file extension (obtained from `sys_path.suffix`) is present in the `_ignore` list. If it is, the file is considered invalid.
- Additionally, it checks if the file name is equal to ".docignore", ".git", ".gitignore", or "doc.log". If any of these conditions are true, the file is considered invalid.
- If none of the above conditions are true, the file is considered valid and should not be ignored.

#### Dependencies:
- This method does not have any dependencies.
