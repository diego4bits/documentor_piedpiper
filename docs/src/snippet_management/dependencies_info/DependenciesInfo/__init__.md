## `__init__(self, node: Node, file_str: str)`

#### Description:
This method initializes an instance of the DependenciesInfo class. It takes a Node object and a string representing the file as parameters. The method extracts and sets the dependencies of the file using the _get_imports_string method.

#### Parameters:
- `node` (`Node`): The Node object representing the file's syntax tree.
- `file_str` (`str`): A string representing the content of the file.

#### Returns:
This method does not have a return value.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Create an instance of DependenciesInfo
info = DependenciesInfo(node, file_str)

# Access the dependencies
print(info.dependencies)
```

#### How it Works:
The method takes a Node object and a file string as parameters. It calls the _get_imports_string method to extract and set the dependencies of the file. The extracted dependencies are stored in the 'dependencies' attribute of the instance.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: A dependency from the tree_sitter module representing the syntax tree of the file.
