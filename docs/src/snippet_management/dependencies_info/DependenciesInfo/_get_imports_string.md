## `_get_imports_string(node: Node, file_str: str) -> str`

#### Description:
This method performs the retrieval of import statements from a given node and file string. It belongs to the class `DependenciesInfo`.

#### Parameters:
- `node` (`Node`): The node from which the import statements will be extracted.
- `file_str` (`str`): The string representation of the file containing the node.

#### Returns:
- `str`: A string representation of the import statements.

#### Dependencies:
- `get_dependencies`: This method is imported from the `tree_sitter_logic.tree_sitter_util` module. It is used to retrieve the dependencies of a given node.
- `get_implementation`: This method is imported from the `tree_sitter_logic.tree_sitter_util` module. It is used to get the implementation of a given dependency node.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = _get_imports_string(node, file_str)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = _get_imports_string(node, file_str)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first calls `get_dependencies` to retrieve the dependency nodes from the given `node`. Then, it iterates over each dependency node and calls `get_implementation` to get the implementation of each dependency. The import statements are appended to a list. Finally, the list of import statements is joined with newline characters to form the `imports_string`, which is returned.
