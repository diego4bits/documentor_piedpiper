#### Attributes:
- `dependencies` (`str`): A string representing the file dependencies.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = DependenciesInfo(dependencies)
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `DependenciesInfo` class is used to store and manage information about the dependencies of a file. It has a single attribute `dependencies` which is a string representing the dependencies of the file.

#### Dependencies:
- `tree_sitter_logic.tree_sitter_util`: This dependency provides utility functions to work with tree-sitter, a parsing library. It is used in the class to get dependencies and implementation of a file.
- `dataclasses`: This dependency provides the `dataclass` decorator which is used to create a data class for the `DependenciesInfo` class.
- `tree_sitter`: This dependency provides the `Node` class which is used in the class to work with tree-sitter nodes.
