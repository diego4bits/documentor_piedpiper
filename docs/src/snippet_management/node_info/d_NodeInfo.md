## `NodeInfo`

#### Description:
This class represents information about a node in a tree structure. It provides functionalities for accessing and manipulating the properties of a node.

#### Attributes:
- `node` (`Node`): The node object representing a specific entity or concept in the tree structure.
- `parent_type` (`str`): The type of the parent node that contains the current node.
- `parent_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the parent node that contains the current node.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
node = Node(...)
instance = NodeInfo(node, parent_type, parent_identifier)
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:
This class is used to store information about a node in a tree structure. The `node` attribute represents the actual node object in the tree. The `parent_type` attribute stores the type of the parent node that contains the current node. The `parent_identifier` attribute stores the identifier of the parent node that contains the current node. These attributes can be accessed and manipulated to perform operations on the node and its parent.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node` from the `tree_sitter` module: This class depends on the `Node` class from the `tree_sitter` module to represent the node object in the tree structure.
