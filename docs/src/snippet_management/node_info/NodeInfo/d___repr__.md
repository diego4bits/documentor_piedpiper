## `__repr__() -> str`

#### Description:
This method returns a string representation of the object. It is used to provide a concise and unambiguous representation of the object. This method belongs to the class NodeInfo.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
- `str`: The string representation of the object.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not raise any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
node = NodeInfo()
result = repr(node)
print(result)
```

#### How it Works:

The `__repr__` method internally calls the `__str__` method to get the string representation of the object. The `__str__` method should be implemented in the class NodeInfo to provide a meaningful string representation. If `__str__` is not implemented, the default implementation provided by the object class will be used, which may not be very informative.

#### Dependencies:
- This method does not have any dependencies.
