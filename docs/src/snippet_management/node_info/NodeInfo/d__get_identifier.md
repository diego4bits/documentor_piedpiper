## `_get_identifier(node: Node, file_str: str) -> str`

#### Description:
This method performs a search in the given node for an identifier and returns it as a string. It belongs to the class `NodeInfo`.

#### Parameters:
- `node` (`Node`): The node to search for an identifier.
- `file_str` (`str`): The string representation of the file where the node is located.

#### Returns:
- `str`: The identifier found in the node, or None if no identifier is found.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = _get_identifier(node, file_str)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = _get_identifier(node, file_str)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method iterates through the children of the given node. If a child has a type of "identifier", it extracts the corresponding substring from the file string and returns it. If no identifier is found, it returns None.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: It is a class imported from the 'tree_sitter' module. It represents a node in the syntax tree.
- `str`: It is a built-in Python type representing a string.
