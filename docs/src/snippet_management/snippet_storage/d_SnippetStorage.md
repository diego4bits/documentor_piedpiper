## `SnippetStorage`

#### Description:
This class represents a storage system for code snippets and provides functionalities for managing and storing code snippets.

#### Attributes:
- `_storage` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): A dictionary that stores code snippets, where the keys are integers representing unique identifiers for each code snippet, and the values are instances of the `CodeSnippet` class. The default value is an empty dictionary.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Creating an instance of SnippetStorage
storage = SnippetStorage()

# Storing a code snippet
snippet = CodeSnippet(code="print('Hello, World!')", language="Python")
storage.store_snippet(snippet)

# Retrieving a code snippet
stored_snippet = storage.get_snippet(1)
print(stored_snippet.code) # Output: print('Hello, World!')
print(stored_snippet.language) # Output: Python
```

#### How it Works:

The `SnippetStorage` class uses a dictionary to store code snippets. Each code snippet is associated with a unique identifier, which is an integer. The class provides methods for storing and retrieving code snippets from the storage.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: This class represents a code snippet and is used to store code snippets in the `SnippetStorage` class.
- `Dict` and `Union` from the `typing` module: These are used to define the type hints for the `_storage` attribute.
