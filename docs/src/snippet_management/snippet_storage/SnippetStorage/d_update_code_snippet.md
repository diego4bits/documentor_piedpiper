## `update_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method performs the update of a code snippet in the snippet storage. It checks if the code snippet already exists in the storage, and if so, updates it with the new information provided. This method belongs to the class SnippetStorage.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet object that needs to be updated in the snippet storage.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns True if the code snippet was successfully updated in the storage. Returns False if the code snippet does not exist in the storage.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
code_snippet1 = CodeSnippet("snippet1", "print('Hello, World!')")
storage = SnippetStorage()
storage.update_code_snippet(code_snippet1)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the code snippet already exists in the storage. If it does not exist, it returns False indicating that the update was not successful. If the code snippet exists, it calculates the hash of the code snippet and updates the storage with the hashed snippet as the key and the code snippet object as the value. Finally, it returns True indicating that the update was successful.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet with a name and code content.
- This method does not have any additional dependencies.
