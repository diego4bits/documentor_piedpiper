## `get_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> Union[CodeSnippet, None]`

#### Description:
This method retrieves a code snippet from the storage based on its hashed value. It belongs to the class SnippetStorage.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet object to be retrieved from the storage.

#### Returns:
- `Union[CodeSnippet, None]`: The code snippet object if it exists in the storage, otherwise None.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
snippet = CodeSnippet("print('Hello, World!')")
storage = SnippetStorage()
storage.add_code_snippet(snippet)
result = storage.get_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result)

# Output:
# <CodeSnippet object at 0x00000123>

# Another use case (if applicable)
result = storage.get_code_snippet(CodeSnippet("print('Hello, World!')"))
print(result)

# Output:
# None
```

#### How it Works:
The method first calculates the hash value of the given code snippet. It then checks if the hashed snippet exists in the storage. If it does, the corresponding code snippet object is returned. Otherwise, None is returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet object. It is used as a parameter and return type in the method.
- This method does not have any other dependencies.
