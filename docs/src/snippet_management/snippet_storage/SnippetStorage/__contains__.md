## `__contains__(self, code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method checks whether a given `code_snippet` is present in the `SnippetStorage` object. It belongs to the class `SnippetStorage` and is used to determine if a specific `CodeSnippet` object is stored in the `SnippetStorage` object.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The `CodeSnippet` object to be checked for presence in the `SnippetStorage` object.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the `code_snippet` is present in the `SnippetStorage` object, otherwise returns `False`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to check if a code snippet is present in the snippet storage
snippet_storage = SnippetStorage()
snippet1 = CodeSnippet("snippet1", "print('Hello, World!')")
snippet2 = CodeSnippet("snippet2", "for i in range(10):\n    print(i)")
snippet_storage.add_code_snippet(snippet1)
snippet_storage.add_code_snippet(snippet2)

# checking if snippet1 is present in the snippet storage
if snippet1 in snippet_storage:
    print("snippet1 is present in the snippet storage")
else:
    print("snippet1 is not present in the snippet storage")
    
# checking if snippet2 is present in the snippet storage
if snippet2 in snippet_storage:
    print("snippet2 is present in the snippet storage")
else:
    print("snippet2 is not present in the snippet storage")
```

#### How it Works:
The method `__contains__` uses the `isinstance()` function to check if the given `code_snippet` object is an instance of `CodeSnippet` class. If the given `code_snippet` is present in the `SnippetStorage` object, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet object, which is required to check for its presence in the `SnippetStorage` object.
