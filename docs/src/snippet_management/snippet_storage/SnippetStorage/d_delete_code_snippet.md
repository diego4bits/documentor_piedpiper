## `delete_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method deletes a code snippet from the SnippetStorage. It belongs to the class SnippetStorage.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet to be deleted from the SnippetStorage.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns True if the code snippet was successfully deleted, otherwise returns False.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
snippet = CodeSnippet(...)
result_case1 = snippet_storage.delete_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
snippet = CodeSnippet(...)
result_case2 = snippet_storage.delete_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the given code snippet exists in the SnippetStorage. If it doesn't exist, it returns False. Otherwise, it calculates the hash value of the code snippet and removes it from the storage using the hash as the key. Finally, it returns True to indicate that the code snippet was successfully deleted.
