## `update_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method performs the update of a code snippet in the snippet storage. It checks if the given code snippet already exists in the storage and updates it if it does. This method belongs to the class SnippetStorage.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet object that needs to be updated in the storage.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns True if the code snippet was successfully updated in the storage, otherwise returns False.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
snippet = CodeSnippet(...)
result_case1 = snippet_storage.update_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = snippet_storage.update_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the given code snippet already exists in the storage by checking if it is present in the storage dictionary. If the code snippet is not found in the storage, the method returns False indicating that the update was unsuccessful. 

If the code snippet is found in the storage, it calculates the hash of the code snippet using the `hash()` function. The hash is used as the key in the storage dictionary to update the code snippet. The method updates the storage dictionary with the new code snippet and returns True indicating that the update was successful.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet object.
- This method does not have any additional dependencies.
