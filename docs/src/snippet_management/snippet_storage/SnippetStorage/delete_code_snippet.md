## `delete_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method deletes a code snippet from the snippet storage. This method belongs to the class `SnippetStorage`.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet to be deleted from the storage.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the code snippet was successfully deleted, `False` otherwise.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Deleting a code snippet from the storage
snippet = CodeSnippet("print('Hello, World!')")
result = snippet_storage.delete_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result)  # True

# Trying to delete a code snippet that does not exist in the storage
snippet = CodeSnippet("print('Goodbye, World!')")
result = snippet_storage.delete_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result)  # False
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the provided `code_snippet` exists in the snippet storage. If it does not exist, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it hashes the `code_snippet` and removes the corresponding entry from the storage using the hashed value. Finally, it returns `True` to indicate that the code snippet was successfully deleted.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: Represents a code snippet and is required as a parameter.
