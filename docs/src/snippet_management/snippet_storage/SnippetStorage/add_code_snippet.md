## `add_code_snippet(code_snippet: CodeSnippet) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method adds a code snippet to the snippet storage. It checks if the snippet is already in the storage and returns False if it is. Otherwise, it generates a hash for the snippet and adds it to the storage.

#### Parameters:
- `code_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): The code snippet to be added to the storage.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: True if the snippet was successfully added to the storage, False if it already exists in the storage.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate adding a code snippet to the storage
snippet = CodeSnippet("print('Hello, world!')")
result = snippet_storage.add_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result)  # True

# Adding an existing code snippet to the storage
result = snippet_storage.add_code_snippet(snippet)
print(result)  # False
```

#### How it Works:
The method checks if the code snippet already exists in the storage by comparing it with the existing snippets. If it exists, it returns False. Otherwise, it generates a hash for the snippet and adds it to the storage using the hash as the key.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: A class representing a code snippet.
