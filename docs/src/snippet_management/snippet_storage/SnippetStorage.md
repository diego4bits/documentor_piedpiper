## `SnippetStorage`

#### Description:
This class represents a storage for code snippets and provides functionalities for managing and accessing these snippets.

#### Attributes:
- `_storage` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): A dictionary that stores code snippets, where the key is the snippet ID and the value is an instance of the `CodeSnippet` class. Default: an empty dictionary.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Creating an instance of SnippetStorage
storage = SnippetStorage()

# Accessing the code snippets stored in the storage
snippets = storage._storage
```

#### How it Works:
The `SnippetStorage` class is used to store and manage code snippets. It has a dictionary attribute `_storage` that holds the snippets. The keys of the dictionary are the IDs of the snippets, and the values are instances of the `CodeSnippet` class. This class provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve code snippets from the storage.

#### Dependencies:
- `CodeSnippet`: This class represents a code snippet and provides functionalities for managing the snippet's content and metadata.
- `Dict` and `Union` from the `typing` module: These modules are used to define the type hints for the `_storage` attribute.
