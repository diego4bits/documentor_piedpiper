## `CodeSnippet`

#### Description:
This class represents a code snippet and provides functionalities for managing and extracting information about the code snippet.

#### Attributes:
- `file_path` (`Path`): The path of the file containing the code snippet.
- `file_name` (`str`): The name of the file containing the code snippet.
- `file_extension` (`str`): The extension of the file containing the code snippet.
- `dependencies` (`str`): The dependencies of the code snippet.
- `parent_type` (`str`): The type of the parent entity that the code snippet belongs to.
- `parent_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the parent entity that the code snippet belongs to.
- `code_snippet_type` (`str`): The type of the code snippet.
- `code_snippet_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the code snippet.
- `code_snippet_implementation` (`str`): The implementation of the code snippet.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
file_path = Path("path/to/file")
file_name = "file_name"
file_extension = ".py"
dependencies = "dependency1, dependency2"
parent_type = "class"
parent_identifier = "ClassName"
code_snippet_type = "method"
code_snippet_identifier = "method_name"
code_snippet_implementation = "def method_name(self):\n    # Code implementation"
snippet = CodeSnippet(file_path, file_name, file_extension, dependencies, parent_type, parent_identifier, code_snippet_type, code_snippet_identifier, code_snippet_implementation)
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `CodeSnippet` class represents a code snippet and provides functionalities for managing and extracting information about the code snippet. It has attributes to store information such as the file path, file name, file extension, dependencies, parent type, parent identifier, code snippet type, code snippet identifier, and code snippet implementation.

The class can be instantiated by passing the required information as arguments to the constructor. Once an instance is created, the attributes can be accessed and modified as needed.

#### Dependencies:
- `Path`: Represents a path to a file or directory.
- `str`: Represents a string.
- `snippet_management.snippet_extract.SnippetExtract`: Provides functionalities for extracting information from code snippets.
- `snippet_management.dependencies_info.DependenciesInfo`: Provides functionalities for managing dependencies of code snippets.
- `file_handler.file_handler.FileHandler`: Provides functionalities for handling files.
- `dataclasses.dataclass`: A decorator that allows defining a class as a data class.
- `dataclasses.field`: A function that allows specifying the fields of a data class.
- `dataclasses.asdict`: A function that returns a dictionary representation of a data class.
- `pathlib.Path`: Represents a path to a file or directory.

This class has the following dependencies:
- `Path` from `pathlib`: Used to handle file paths.
- `snippet_management.snippet_extract.SnippetExtract`: Used to extract information from code snippets.
- `snippet_management.dependencies_info.DependenciesInfo`: Used to manage dependencies of code snippets.
- `file_handler.file_handler.FileHandler`: Used to handle files.
- `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dataclasses.field`, `dataclasses.asdict`: Used to define a data class and its fields.
- `pathlib.Path`: Used to represent file paths.
