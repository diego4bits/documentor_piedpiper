## `__hash__() -> int`

#### Description:
This method calculates the hash value for the instance of the `CodeSnippet` class. It is used to provide a unique identifier for the object. This method belongs to the class `CodeSnippet`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The hash value of the `CodeSnippet` instance.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Example usage case
snippet = CodeSnippet()
hash_value = snippet.__hash__()
print(hash_value)
```

#### How it Works:
The `__hash__()` method calculates the hash value for the `CodeSnippet` instance by hashing a tuple of the following attributes:
- `file_path` (str): The path of the code snippet file.
- `file_name` (str): The name of the code snippet file.
- `file_extension` (str): The extension of the code snippet file.
- `code_snippet_type` (str): The type of the code snippet.
- `code_snippet_identifier` (str): The identifier of the code snippet.

The `hash()` function is used to calculate the hash value of the tuple, and the resulting value is returned.
