## `CodeSnippet`

#### Description:
This class represents a code snippet and provides functionalities for managing and extracting information from code snippets.

#### Attributes:
- `file_path` (`Path`): The path of the file where the code snippet is located.
- `file_name` (`str`): The name of the file where the code snippet is located.
- `file_extension` (`str`): The extension of the file where the code snippet is located.
- `dependencies` (`str`): The dependencies of the code snippet.
- `parent_type` (`str`): The type of the parent entity that the code snippet belongs to.
- `parent_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the parent entity that the code snippet belongs to.
- `code_snippet_type` (`str`): The type of the code snippet.
- `code_snippet_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the code snippet.
- `code_snippet_implementation` (`str`): The implementation of the code snippet. Default: `None`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
from pathlib import Path
instance = CodeSnippet(Path('/path/to/file'), 'file_name', 'py', 'dependency1, dependency2', 'class', 'class_name', 'method', 'method_name', 'def method_name():\n    # code snippet implementation')
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

This class represents a code snippet and is used for managing and extracting information from code snippets. It has attributes to store information such as the file path, file name, file extension, dependencies, parent type, parent identifier, code snippet type, code snippet identifier, and code snippet implementation.
