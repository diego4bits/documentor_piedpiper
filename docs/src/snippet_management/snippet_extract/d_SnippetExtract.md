## `SnippetExtract`

#### Description:
This class represents a snippet extract and provides functionalities for accessing and manipulating information related to the snippet.

#### Attributes:
- `parent_type` (`str`): The type of the parent node of the snippet.
- `parent_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the parent node of the snippet.
- `snippet_type` (`str`): The type of the snippet.
- `snippet_identifier` (`str`): The identifier of the snippet.
- `snippet_implementation` (`str`): The implementation of the snippet.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
snippet = SnippetExtract(parent_type='function', parent_identifier='function_name', snippet_type='loop', snippet_identifier='loop_1', snippet_implementation='for i in range(10):')
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `SnippetExtract` class is used to represent a snippet extract. It contains information about the parent node of the snippet, the type of the snippet, and its identifier and implementation.

#### Dependencies:
- `tree_sitter_logic`: This dependency provides utility functions for working with tree-sitter, a parsing library for tree-based grammars.
- `get_identifier()`: This function is used to get the identifier of a node in the syntax tree.
- `get_implementation()`: This function is used to get the implementation of a node in the syntax tree.
- `NodeInfo`: This class provides information about a node in the syntax tree.
- `dataclasses`: This module provides the `dataclass` decorator for creating data classes.
