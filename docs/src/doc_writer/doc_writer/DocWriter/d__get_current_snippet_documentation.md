Finally, it retrieves the documentation answer by calling the `get_documentation_answer()` method from the `DocumentorChat` class and assigns it to the `snippet_documentation` attribute of the `DocWriter` class.

#### Dependencies:
- `DocumentorChat`: A class that provides methods for interacting with a chat interface to ask for documentation.
- This method depends on the `DocumentorChat` class for setting the current snippet, asking for documentation, and retrieving the documentation answer.
