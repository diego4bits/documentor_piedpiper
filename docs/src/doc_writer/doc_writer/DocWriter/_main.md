## `_main()`

#### Description:
This method performs the main logic for documenting snippets. It retrieves the snippets to document, iterates over each snippet, sets the current snippet, and documents it. This method belongs to the class `DocWriter`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return anything.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
doc_writer = DocWriter()
doc_writer._main()

# Another use case (if applicable)
```

#### How it Works:
The `_main()` method follows these steps:
1. It calls the `_get_snippets_to_doc()` method to retrieve the snippets that need to be documented.
2. It iterates over each snippet in the `snippets_to_doc` dictionary.
3. For each snippet, it calls the `_set_current_snippet()` method to set the current snippet.
4. It calls the `_document_current_snippet()` method to document the current snippet.
