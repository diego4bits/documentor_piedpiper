## `DocWriter`

#### Description:
This class represents a document writer and provides functionalities for generating and managing documentation.

#### Attributes:
- `instance` (`ClassVar`): This attribute holds the instance of the `DocWriter` class. It is a class variable that is shared among all instances of the class.
- `doc_path` (`Path`): This attribute represents the path where the generated documentation will be saved. It is initialized with the value `Path("./docs")`, indicating that the documentation will be saved in the "docs" folder of the current directory.
- `snippets_to_doc` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): This attribute is a dictionary that stores the code snippets to be documented. The keys are integers representing the snippet IDs, and the values are instances of the `CodeSnippet` class.
- `current_snippet` (`CodeSnippet`): This attribute represents the current code snippet being documented. It is an instance of the `CodeSnippet` class.
- `current_doc_path` (`Path`): This attribute represents the path of the current documentation file being written.
- `snippet_documentation` (`str`): This attribute stores the documentation for the current code snippet.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = DocWriter()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

This class provides functionalities for generating and managing documentation. It allows the user to specify the path where the documentation will be saved and provides methods for adding code snippets to be documented. The class keeps track of the current code snippet being documented and the path of the current documentation file being written. It also stores the documentation for each code snippet.
