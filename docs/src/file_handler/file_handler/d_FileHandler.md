## `FileHandler`

#### Description:
This class represents a file handler and provides functionalities for file manipulation and processing.

#### Attributes:
- `attribute1` (`GitRetrieaver`): An instance of the `GitRetrieaver` class used for retrieving files from a git repository.
- `attribute2` (`Path`): The path to the file that will be handled.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
from git_tools.git_retrieaver import GitRetrieaver
from pathlib import Path

git_retrieaver = GitRetrieaver()
file_path = Path("path/to/file")

file_handler = FileHandler(git_retrieaver, file_path)
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:
The `FileHandler` class is responsible for handling files and performing various operations on them. It requires an instance of the `GitRetrieaver` class, which is used for retrieving files from a git repository. The `FileHandler` class also requires a `Path` object representing the path to the file that will be handled.

- `GitRetrieaver`: This class is used for retrieving files from a git repository.
- `Path`: This class is used for representing file paths.
