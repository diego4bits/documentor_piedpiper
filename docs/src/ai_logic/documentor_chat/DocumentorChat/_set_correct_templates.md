## `_set_correct_templates()`

#### Description:
This method determines the correct template to use for generating documentation based on the type of code snippet being processed. It sets the appropriate template for generating class, method, or function documentation. This method belongs to the class `DocumentorChat`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return any value.

#### Exceptions:

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Example usage case
documentor._set_correct_templates()
```

#### How it Works:
The method checks the type of the code snippet being processed. If the code snippet type is a class definition, it calls the `_set_class_documentation()` method to set the class documentation template. If the code snippet type is a function definition and its parent type is a class definition, it calls the `_set_method_documentation()` method to set the method documentation template. If the code snippet type is a function definition and its parent type is the root node, it calls the `_set_function_documentation()` method to set the function documentation template.

#### Dependencies:
- `snippet_to_doc`: The code snippet object that contains information about the code being documented.
