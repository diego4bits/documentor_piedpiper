## `GitFilePaths`

#### Description:
This class represents a collection of file paths in a git repository and provides functionalities for managing and manipulating these paths.

#### Attributes:
- `git_manager` (`GitManager`): An instance of the `GitManager` class that provides methods for interacting with a git repository.
- `doc_ignore` (`DocIgnore`): An instance of the `DocIgnore` class that allows for excluding certain files or directories from the collection of file paths.
- `file_paths` (`List[str]`): A list of file paths in the git repository.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Instantiating the class
git_file_paths = GitFilePaths(git_manager, doc_ignore)

# Accessing the file paths
paths = git_file_paths.file_paths

# Adding a new file path
git_file_paths.add_file_path("/path/to/new_file.py")

# Removing a file path
git_file_paths.remove_file_path("/path/to/file.py")
```

#### How it Works:

The `GitFilePaths` class uses an instance of the `GitManager` class to interact with a git repository and retrieve the file paths. It also uses an instance of the `DocIgnore` class to exclude certain files or directories from the collection of file paths. The file paths are stored in a list called `file_paths`.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager`: Provides methods for interacting with a git repository.
- `DocIgnore`: Allows for excluding certain files or directories from the collection of file paths.
