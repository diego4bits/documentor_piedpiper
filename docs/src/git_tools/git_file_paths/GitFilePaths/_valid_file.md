## `_valid_file(sys_path: Path) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method checks if a given file is valid or not. It is used to determine whether a file should be included or excluded based on certain conditions. This method belongs to the class `GitFilePaths`.

#### Parameters:
- `sys_path` (`Path`): The path of the file to be checked for validity.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the file is valid, otherwise `False`.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not raise any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
file_path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")
result = _valid_file(file_path)
print(result)  # True

# Another use case (if applicable)
file_path = Path("/path/to/.gitignore")
result = _valid_file(file_path)
print(result)  # False
```

#### How it Works:
The method checks if the given file satisfies any of the following conditions:
- The file name is present in the `doc_ignore` list of the `GitFilePaths` class.
- The file suffix (extension) is present in the `doc_ignore` list of the `GitFilePaths` class.
- The file name is ".docignore", ".git", ".gitignore", or "doc.log".

If any of these conditions are met, the method returns `False`, indicating that the file is not valid. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the file is valid.
