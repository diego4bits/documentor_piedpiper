## `get_all_valid_paths(git_tree: Tree = None, parent_path: Path = Path(".")) -> List[Path]`

#### Description:
This method performs the process of retrieving all valid file paths within a given git tree or the current commit tree. It belongs to the class `GitFilePaths` and is used to obtain a list of valid file paths.

#### Parameters:
- `git_tree` (`Tree`, optional): The git tree from which to retrieve the file paths. If not provided, the method will select the front commit and use its tree.
- `parent_path` (`Path`, optional): The parent path to append to each file path. Defaults to the current working directory.

#### Returns:
- `List[Path]`: A list of valid file paths within the given git tree or commit tree.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Retrieve all valid file paths using the current commit tree and the current working directory as the parent path
result_case1 = get_all_valid_paths()
print(result_case1)

# Retrieve all valid file paths using a specific git tree and a custom parent path
result_case2 = get_all_valid_paths(git_tree=my_git_tree, parent_path=my_parent_path)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
1. If `git_tree` is not provided, the method selects the front commit and uses its tree.
2. Iterate over each entry in the git tree.
3. Create the full path by appending the entry name to the parent path.
4. Check various conditions to determine if the path is valid:
   - If the full path does not exist, skip the entry.
   - If the entry type is a commit, skip the entry.
   - If the full path is not a valid file, skip the entry.
5. If the full path is a file, append it to the list of paths.
6. If the full path is a directory, recursively call `get_all_valid_paths` with the corresponding tree and parent path, and append the resulting paths to the list.
7. Return the list of valid file paths.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager`: Used to select the front commit and retrieve the commit tree.
- `Path`: Used to represent file paths.
- `Tree`: Used to represent the git tree.
- `List`: Used to represent a list of file paths.
