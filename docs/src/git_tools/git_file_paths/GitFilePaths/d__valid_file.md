## `_valid_file(sys_path: Path) -> bool`

#### Description:
This method performs validation on a file path to determine if it is a valid file or not. It is used for filtering out certain file paths. This method belongs to the class `GitFilePaths`.

#### Parameters:
- `sys_path` (`Path`): The file path to be validated.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the file path is valid, `False` otherwise.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = _valid_file(path)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = _valid_file(path)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:

The method first splits the file path using the backslash character as a separator and stores the resulting parts in the `divide_path` variable. 

It then applies several conditions to determine if the file path is valid or not. 

1. It checks if any part of the file path is present in the `doc_ignore` list, which is a property of the `GitFilePaths` class. If any part matches, the file path is considered invalid.

2. It checks if the file extension (suffix) is present in the `doc_ignore` list, except for cases where the suffix is empty. If the suffix matches and is not empty, the file path is considered invalid.

3. It checks if the file name is equal to ".docignore", ".git", ".gitignore", "doc.log", "documentor". If the file name matches, the file path is considered invalid.

4. It checks if the suffix is not equal to ".py" and the file is a regular file (not a directory). If both conditions are met, the file path is considered invalid.

If none of these conditions are met, the file path is considered valid.
