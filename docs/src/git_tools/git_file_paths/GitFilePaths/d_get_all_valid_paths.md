## `get_all_valid_paths(git_tree: Tree = None, parent_path: Path = Path(".")) -> List[Path]`

#### Description:
This method performs the retrieval of all valid file paths within a given Git tree. It is used for obtaining a list of file paths that exist in the Git repository. This method belongs to the class `GitFilePaths`.

#### Parameters:
- `git_tree` (`Tree`, optional): The Git tree object from which to retrieve the file paths. If not specified, the front commit's tree will be selected using `GitManager.select_front_commit()` and `GitManager.selected_commit_tree()`. Default is `None`.
- `parent_path` (`Path`): The parent path to append to the file paths. Default is the current directory (`Path(".")`).

#### Returns:
- `List[Path]`: A list of `Path` objects representing the valid file paths in the Git tree.

#### Exceptions:
None.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = get_all_valid_paths()
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = get_all_valid_paths(git_tree, parent_path)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first initializes an empty list called `paths` to store the valid file paths. If no `git_tree` is provided, it selects the front commit's tree using `GitManager.select_front_commit()` and `GitManager.selected_commit_tree()`.

Next, it iterates through each entry in the `git_tree`. For each entry, it constructs the full path by appending the entry's name to the `parent_path`. It then checks several conditions to determine if the entry is a valid file path:

- If the full path does not exist, or
- If the entry is a commit object, or
- If the full path is not a valid file (checked using a private method `_valid_file()`),

If any of these conditions are met, the method continues to the next entry.

If the full path is a valid file (checked using `full_path.is_file()`), it is appended to the `paths` list.

If the full path is a valid directory (checked using `full_path.is_dir()`), the method recursively calls itself with the Git tree of the current entry and the full path as the parent path. The resulting list of valid file paths from the recursive call is then extended to the `paths` list.

Finally, the method returns the `paths` list containing all the valid file paths.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager`: This dependency provides access to Git-related functionality such as selecting the front commit and retrieving the commit tree.
- `Path`: This dependency is from the `pathlib` module and is used for handling file paths.
- `Tree`: This dependency is from the `pygit2` module and represents a Git tree object.
