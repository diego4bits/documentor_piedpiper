## `GitFilePaths`

#### Description:
This class represents a collection of file paths within a Git repository and provides functionalities for managing and manipulating these paths.

#### Attributes:
- `git_manager` (`GitManager`): An instance of the `GitManager` class, which is responsible for interacting with the Git repository.
- `doc_ignore` (`DocIgnore`): An instance of the `DocIgnore` class, which is used to ignore certain files or directories when collecting file paths.
- `path` (`Path`): The path to the Git repository.
- `tree` (`Tree`): The current Git tree object representing the files in the repository.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
git_manager = GitManager()
doc_ignore = DocIgnore()
path = Path('/path/to/git/repository')
instance = GitFilePaths(git_manager, doc_ignore, path)
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:
The `GitFilePaths` class works by utilizing the `GitManager` class to interact with the Git repository. It allows you to specify a path to the repository and then collects the file paths within it. The `DocIgnore` class is used to ignore certain files or directories based on predefined rules. The class uses a `Tree` object from the `pygit2` library to represent the files in the repository.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager`: This class is responsible for interacting with the Git repository.
- `DocIgnore`: This class is used to ignore certain files or directories when collecting file paths.
- `Path` (from `pathlib`): This class is used to represent file system paths.
- `Tree` (from `pygit2`): This class is used to represent the files in the Git repository.
