## `GitManager`

#### Description:
This class represents a Git manager and provides functionalities for managing a Git repository.

#### Attributes:
- `instance` (`ClassVar`): A class variable that holds an instance of the `GitManager` class. This is used to implement the Singleton design pattern.
- `project_repo` (`Repository`): Represents the Git repository associated with the project.
- `head_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the latest commit in the Git repository.
- `front_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the first commit in the Git repository.
- `tail_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the last commit in the Git repository.
- `selected_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the currently selected commit in the Git repository.
- `front_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the file tree of the first commit in the Git repository.
- `tail_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the file tree of the last commit in the Git repository.
- `selected_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the file tree of the currently selected commit in the Git repository.
- `project_file_paths` (`List[Path]`): A list of `Path` objects representing the file paths in the project repository.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = GitManager()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `GitManager` class provides a way to manage a Git repository. It allows accessing information about the commits, file trees, and file paths in the repository. The class utilizes the PyGit2 library for interacting with Git repositories.

#### Dependencies:
- `SingletonMeta`: A metaclass that implements the Singleton design pattern. It ensures that only one instance of the `GitManager` class can exist.
- `Path`: A class from the `pathlib` module that represents a file system path.
- `Repository`: A class from the `pygit2` module that represents a Git repository.
- `Commit`: A class from the `pygit2` module that represents a Git commit.
- `Tree`: A class from the `pygit2` module that represents a Git file tree.
- `List`: A generic class from the `typing` module that represents a list.
