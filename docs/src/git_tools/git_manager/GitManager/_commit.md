## `_commit(commit_msg: str = None) -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs a commit operation in the Git repository. It creates a new commit with the provided commit message or a default message if no message is provided. This method belongs to the class GitManager.

#### Parameters:
- `commit_msg` (`str`, optional): The commit message that will be associated with the new commit. If not provided, a default message will be used.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return anything.

#### Dependencies:
- `SingletonMeta`: This is a metaclass that ensures that only a single instance of the GitManager class is created.
- `Path`: This module provides classes and methods for working with file and directory paths.
- `Repository`: This class represents a Git repository and provides various methods and attributes for interacting with it.
- `Commit`: This class represents a Git commit and provides methods and attributes for accessing its properties.
- `Tree`: This class represents a Git tree and provides methods and attributes for accessing its properties.
- `ClassVar`: This is a type hint that indicates that the variable is a class variable.
- `List`: This is a generic type hint that indicates a list of elements.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Commit with a custom message
manager._commit("Fix bug #123")

# Commit with a default message
manager._commit()
```

#### How it Works:
- If a commit message is provided, it is assigned to the `commit_msg` variable. Otherwise, a default message is generated using the short ID of the head commit.
- The Git repository associated with the GitManager instance is obtained.
- The default author signature is retrieved from the repository.
- The index is written to a tree object.
- A new commit is created using the "create_commit" method of the repository, passing the head reference, author signature, commit message, tree object, and the target of the head commit.
