## `_commit(commit_msg: str = None) -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs a commit operation and is used for creating a new commit in the Git repository. This method belongs to the class `GitManager`.

#### Parameters:
- `commit_msg` (`str`, optional): The commit message that describes the changes made in the commit. If not provided, a default commit message will be used.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return any value.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
git_manager._commit("Fixed a bug in the login feature")

# Another use case (if applicable)
git_manager._commit()
```

#### How it Works:
1. If a commit message is not provided, a default commit message is generated using the short ID of the head commit.
2. The `project_repo` attribute of the `GitManager` instance is accessed to get the Git repository object.
3. The default author signature is retrieved from the repository.
4. The repository's index is written to create a tree object representing the changes made in the commit.
5. The commit is created using the `create_commit` method of the repository object, specifying the author, commit message, tree, and the target of the current head.

- `Tree`: Represents a Git tree.
