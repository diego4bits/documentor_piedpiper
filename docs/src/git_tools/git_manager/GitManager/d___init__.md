## `__init__(repo_path: Path = Path.cwd())`

#### Description:
This method initializes an instance of the GitManager class. It sets up the necessary attributes for managing a Git repository. 

#### Parameters:
- `repo_path` (`Path`): The path to the Git repository. If not provided, the current working directory is used.

#### Returns:
- None

#### Exceptions:
- `Exception`: This exception is raised if there is no head parent commit in the repository.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Initialize GitManager with default repository path
git_manager = GitManager()
print(git_manager)

# Initialize GitManager with custom repository path
git_manager = GitManager(Path('/path/to/repository'))
print(git_manager)
```

#### How it Works:
- The method takes an optional parameter `repo_path` which represents the path to the Git repository. If the `repo_path` is not provided, it sets the `repo_path` to the current working directory.
- It initializes the `project_repo` attribute with the Git repository at the specified `repo_path`.
- It retrieves the head commit using `self.project_repo.head.peel(Commit)` and assigns it to the `head_commit` attribute.
- The `front_commit` attribute is set to the same value as `head_commit`.
- The `front_commit_tree` attribute is set to the tree of `front_commit`.
- If the `head_commit` has a parent commit, the `tail_commit` attribute is set to the parent commit. Otherwise, it raises an exception indicating that there is no head parent commit.
- The `tail_commit_tree` attribute is set to the tree of `tail_commit`.
- The `selected_commit` attribute is set to `tail_commit`.
- The `selected_commit_tree` attribute is set to `tail_commit_tree`.

#### Dependencies:
- `Path` from `pathlib`: Represents a path in the file system.
- `Repository`, `Commit`, `Tree` from `pygit2`: Provides Git repository management functionality.
- `ClassVar`, `List` from `typing`: Used for type hints.
