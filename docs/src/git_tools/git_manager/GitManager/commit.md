## `commit(commit_msg: str = None) -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs a commit operation and is used for saving changes to a git repository. This method belongs to the class GitManager.

#### Parameters:
- `commit_msg` (`str`, optional): The message associated with the commit. If not provided, it defaults to None.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return any value.

#### Exceptions:
- None: This method does not raise any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
GitManager.instance.commit("Added new feature")

# Another use case (if applicable)
GitManager.instance.commit("Fixed bug")
```

#### How it Works:
The `commit` method in the `GitManager` class is responsible for saving changes to a git repository. It takes an optional `commit_msg` parameter, which represents the message associated with the commit. If no `commit_msg` is provided, it defaults to None. This method internally calls the `_commit` method of the `GitManager.instance` object.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager.instance`: An instance of the `GitManager` class.
- `_commit(commit_msg: str)`: A private method in the `GitManager` class responsible for performing the actual commit operation.
