- `head_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the latest commit in the repository. Default: `None`.
- `front_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the front commit in the repository. Default: `None`.
- `tail_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the tail commit in the repository. Default: `None`.
- `selected_commit` (`Commit`): Represents the selected commit in the repository. Default: `None`.
- `front_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the tree associated with the front commit. Default: `None`.
- `tail_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the tree associated with the tail commit. Default: `None`.
- `selected_commit_tree` (`Tree`): Represents the tree associated with the selected commit. Default: `None`.
- `project_file_paths` (`List[Path]`): Represents a list of file paths in the project. Default: `[]`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = GitManager()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The GitManager class is responsible for managing a Git repository. It provides functionalities for accessing and manipulating the repository, such as retrieving the latest commit, front commit, tail commit, and selected commit. It also allows access to the trees associated with these commits. The project_file_paths attribute holds a list of file paths in the project.

#### Dependencies:
- `SingletonMeta`: A metaclass that ensures only one instance of the class is created.
- `Path`: Represents a file or directory path.
- `Repository`: Represents a Git repository.
- `Commit`: Represents a Git commit.
- `Tree`: Represents a Git tree.
- `List`: Represents a list data structure in Python.
