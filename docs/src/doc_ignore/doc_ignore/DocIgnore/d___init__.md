## `__init__(self, root_path: Path = None) -> None`

#### Description:
This method initializes an instance of the `DocIgnore` class. It sets up the `ignore` attribute based on the contents of the `.docignore` file located at the root directory of the project. If the file exists, it retrieves its contents, cleans up the lines, and assigns the resulting set to the `ignore` attribute. If the file does not exist, it raises an exception indicating that the `.docignore` file was not found.

#### Parameters:
- `root_path` (`Path`, optional): The root directory path of the project. If not provided, the current directory is used as the default value.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return any value.

#### Exceptions:
- `Exception`: This exception is raised when the `.docignore` file is not found at the root directory.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Initialize DocIgnore with default root path
doc_ignore = DocIgnore()
# DocIgnore object is successfully initialized

# Initialize DocIgnore with a specified root path
root_path = Path("/path/to/project")
doc_ignore = DocIgnore(root_path)
# DocIgnore object is successfully initialized

# Attempt to initialize DocIgnore without a .docignore file
doc_ignore = DocIgnore()
# Raises an exception: DocIgnore_.docignore_not_found: .docignore is not at the root dir
```

#### How it Works:
- If the `root_path` parameter is not provided, the current directory is used as the default root path.
- The `doc_ignore_path` is constructed by appending ".docignore" to the `root_path`.
- If the `doc_ignore_path` file exists:
  - The front commit is selected using `GitManager.select_front_commit()`.
  - The contents of the `doc_ignore_path` file are retrieved using `GitRetrieaver.retrieve_file(doc_ignore_path)`.
  - The contents are split into lines and stored in `doc_lines`.
  - The lines are converted into a set and stored in `doc_set`.
  - Each line in `doc_set` is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and stored in `clean_doc_set`.
  - The `clean_doc_set` is assigned to the `ignore` attribute.
  - The tail commit is selected using `GitManager.select_tail_commit()`.
- If the `doc_ignore_path` file does not exist, an exception is raised indicating that the `.docignore` file was not found.
