## `DocIgnore`

#### Description:
This class represents a document ignore feature and provides functionalities for managing ignored files in a Git repository.

#### Attributes:
- `instance` (`ClassVar`): Represents the instance of the `DocIgnore` class. This attribute is shared among all instances of the class.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = DocIgnore()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `DocIgnore` class allows managing ignored files in a Git repository. It provides functionality to add, remove, and list ignored files. The class follows the singleton pattern, meaning that only one instance of the class can exist.

#### Dependencies:
- `SingletonMeta`: A metaclass that ensures only one instance of a class is created. It is used to implement the singleton pattern for the `DocIgnore` class.
- `GitRetrieaver`: A class that provides methods to retrieve information from a Git repository. It is used by the `DocIgnore` class to get the list of ignored files.
- `GitManager`: A class that provides methods to manage a Git repository. It is used by the `DocIgnore` class to add and remove files from the ignore list.
- `Path`: A class from the `pathlib` module that represents a file system path. It is used by the `DocIgnore` class to handle file paths.
- `ClassVar`: A type hint that indicates that the `instance` attribute is shared among all instances of the class.
