## `_get_class_implementation`

#### Description:
This code snippet is a helper function that is used to get the implementation of a class. It takes a Node object and a string representing the file content as input, and returns the class implementation as a string. If there is no implementation specified in the class, it returns the string "NO ARGUMENTS SPECIFIED IN THIS CLASS".

#### Important info:
This function assumes that the given Node object represents a class in the abstract syntax tree.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to extract the class implementation from a Node object.
- This code snippet is used to check if a class has any implementation specified.
- This code snippet is used to retrieve the implementation of a class as a string.

#### How it Works:
1. It defines a set of valid types for the class implementation, which includes "typed_parameter", "expression_statement", and "assignment".
2. It creates an empty list called `class_implementation`.
3. It iterates over the children of the given Node object.
4. For each child node, it checks if the node type is "block".
5. If the node type is "block", it iterates over the children of the block node.
6. For each block child node, it checks if the node type is one of the valid types defined earlier.
7. If the node type is one of the valid types, it calls the `get_implementation` function (not provided) to get the implementation of the block child node and appends it to the `class_implementation` list.
8. It joins all the elements in the `class_implementation` list with a newline character to form the class implementation string.
9. It returns the class implementation string if it is not empty, otherwise it returns the string "NO ARGUMENTS SPECIFIED IN THIS CLASS".

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: This is a class from the `tree_sitter` module that represents a node in the abstract syntax tree.
- `get_implementation` (not provided): This is a function that is used to get the implementation of a node. It is expected to take a Node object and a string representing the file content as input, and return the implementation as a string.
