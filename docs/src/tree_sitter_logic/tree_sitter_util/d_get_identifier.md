## `get_identifier`

#### Description:
This code snippet is a function that takes a `Node` object and a `file_str` string as input and returns the identifier (a sequence of characters representing a name) found within the given `Node` object in the `file_str`. It is typically used to extract identifiers from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) generated by the Tree-sitter parser.

#### Important info:
- This function assumes that the `Node` object represents a valid AST node.
- If no identifier is found within the `Node` object, `None` is returned.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to extract identifiers from AST nodes.
- It can be used to retrieve variable names, function names, or any other names defined within the code represented by the AST.
- By extracting identifiers, this code snippet enables further analysis and manipulation of the codebase.

#### How it Works:
The function iterates over the children of the given `Node` object. For each child, it checks if the type of the child is "identifier". If so, it returns the substring of `file_str` that corresponds to the range of bytes covered by the child. This substring represents the identifier found within the `Node`.
If no identifier is found in any of the children, `None` is returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node` (from tree_sitter): The `Node` class is imported from the `tree_sitter` module. It represents a node in the abstract syntax tree generated by the Tree-sitter parser.
- `file_str` (str): The `file_str` string is passed as input to the function and represents the source code file or code snippet from which the AST was generated.
