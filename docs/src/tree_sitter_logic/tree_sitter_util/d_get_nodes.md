## `get_nodes`

#### Description:
This code snippet is a function called `get_nodes`. It takes a root node, a set of types, and a file string as input parameters. It returns a list of `NodeInfo` objects. This function is used to retrieve specific nodes from a tree and gather information about them.

#### Important info:
This function relies on the `_recursive_get_nodes` helper function to recursively traverse the tree and find the desired nodes.

#### Usage:
- This code snippet is used to retrieve specific nodes from a tree.
- This code snippet is used to gather information about the retrieved nodes.

#### How it Works:
The `get_nodes` function first creates a `NodeInfo` object for the root node. It then calls the `_recursive_get_nodes` function, passing in the root node info, the set of types, and the file string. The `_recursive_get_nodes` function recursively traverses the tree, starting from the root node, and checks if each node's type matches any of the types in the set. If a match is found, a `NodeInfo` object is created for that node and added to the list of retrieved nodes. Finally, the list of retrieved nodes is returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `NodeInfo`: This is a class defined in the `node_info` module. It is used to store information about each retrieved node.
- `Node`: This is a class imported from the `tree_sitter` module. It represents a node in a tree.
- `List`: This is a class imported from the `typing` module. It represents a list data structure.
- `Set`: This is a class imported from the `typing` module. It represents a set data structure.
