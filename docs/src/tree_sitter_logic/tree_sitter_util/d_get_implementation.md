## `get_implementation`

#### Description:
This code snippet is a function called `get_implementation` that takes a `node` object and a `file_str` string as input and returns the implementation of the given node. It is typically used to extract the implementation code for a specific node, such as a class definition, from a file.

#### Important info:
This function is important for parsing and extracting code information from a file. It allows for the retrieval of the implementation code for different types of nodes.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to extract the implementation code for a class definition node.
- This code snippet is used to extract the implementation code for other types of nodes.

#### How it Works:
The function first initializes an empty string called `implementation`. It then checks if the type of the given `node` is a "class_definition". If it is, it calls the `_get_class_implementation` function passing the `node` and `file_str` as arguments and assigns the result to `implementation`. This function is not provided in the code snippet, so its implementation is not shown here.

If the type of the node is not a "class_definition", the function simply assigns the substring of `file_str` from the `node`'s start byte to its end byte to `implementation`.

Finally, the function returns the `implementation` string.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: This dependency is imported from the `tree_sitter` module. It represents a node in the syntax tree generated by the Tree-sitter parser.
- `List`: This dependency is imported from the `typing` module. It represents a list type.
- `Set`: This dependency is imported from the `typing` module. It represents a set type.
- `NodeInfo`: This dependency is imported from the `snippet_management.node_info` module. It represents information about a node in the syntax tree.
