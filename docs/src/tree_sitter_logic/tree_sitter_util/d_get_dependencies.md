## `get_dependencies`

#### Description:
This code snippet extracts the dependencies from a given root node. It is typically used to obtain the list of dependencies in a codebase.

#### Important info:
This function relies on the `global_node_types` function to extract the dependencies.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to obtain the dependencies in a codebase.
- This code snippet is used to determine the dependencies of a specific root node.
- This code snippet is used to analyze the dependencies of a codebase.

#### How it Works:
The function `get_dependencies` takes a `root` node as input and initializes a set of `dependencies_types` with the values "import_from_statement". 

The function then calls the `global_node_types` function passing the `root` node and the `dependencies_types` set as arguments. This function returns a list of nodes that match the specified types.

Finally, the list of nodes representing the dependencies is returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: Represents a node in the codebase.
- `List`: Represents a list of objects.
- `global_node_types`: A function that extracts nodes of specific types from a codebase.
