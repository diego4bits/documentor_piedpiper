## `_descendants_with_type`

#### Description:
This code snippet performs a recursive search through the descendants of a given `Node` object, looking for nodes with a specific type. It returns a list of all the nodes found with the specified type.

#### Important info:
This function is an internal helper function and is not meant to be called directly from outside the module.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to find all the descendants of a `Node` object with a specific type.
- It is used to perform specific operations on all the nodes found with the specified type.

#### How it Works:
The function takes in a `Node` object and a `node_type` as input. It initializes an empty list called `nodes` to store the found nodes.

It checks if the type of the current node is the same as the specified `node_type`. If it is, the current node is appended to the `nodes` list.

Then, it recursively calls `_descendants_with_type` on each child of the current node, and extends the `nodes` list with the nodes returned by the recursive calls.

Finally, it returns the `nodes` list containing all the nodes found with the specified type.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: This is a class provided by the `tree_sitter` module. It represents a node in the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the Tree-sitter parser.
- `List` and `Set`: These are generic types provided by the `typing` module. They are used to define the type hints for the function parameters and return value.
