## `LanguageNodes`

#### Description:
This class represents a collection of language nodes and provides functionalities for managing and manipulating these nodes.

#### Attributes:
- `py` (`Tuple[Set[str], Set[str]]`): A tuple containing two sets. The first set represents the valid language nodes for Python, including "class_definition" and "function_definition". The second set represents the valid language nodes for Python functions, including "function_definition".

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
nodes = LanguageNodes()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `LanguageNodes` class allows users to create an instance that represents a collection of language nodes. It provides functionalities for managing and manipulating these nodes. The `py` attribute of the class is a tuple that contains two sets. The first set represents the valid language nodes for Python, while the second set represents the valid language nodes for Python functions. This attribute can be used to check if a given node is valid for a specific language or function.

#### Dependencies:
- `tree_sitter.Language`: This dependency is required to use the `Language` class for tree-sitter parsing.
- `enum.Enum`: This dependency is required to use the `Enum` class for defining enums.
- `typing.Tuple`: This dependency is required to use the `Tuple` type for defining tuples.
- `typing.Set`: This dependency is required to use the `Set` type for defining sets.
