## `LanguageNodes`

#### Description:
This class represents a collection of language nodes and provides functionalities for working with them.

#### Attributes:
- `py` (`Tuple[Set[str], Set[str]]`): A tuple containing two sets of strings. The first set represents the available language nodes, while the second set represents the language nodes that are specifically related to function definitions. Default: `(set(), set())`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate instantiation of the class
py_nodes = LanguageNodes.py
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `LanguageNodes` class is a collection of language nodes, which are represented by sets of strings. The `py` attribute represents the language nodes for the Python language. The first set in the `py` tuple contains all available language nodes, while the second set contains the language nodes specifically related to function definitions. The `py` attribute can be accessed directly using `LanguageNodes.py`.
