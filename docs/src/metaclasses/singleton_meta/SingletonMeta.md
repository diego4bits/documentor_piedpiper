## `SingletonMeta`

#### Description:
This class represents a metaclass used for implementing the Singleton design pattern in Python.

#### Attributes:
- `_instances` (`dict`): A dictionary that keeps track of the instances created for each class that uses this metaclass.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        self.arg2 = arg2

instance1 = MyClass(1, 2)
instance2 = MyClass(3, 4)

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Output: True
```

#### How it Works:

The `SingletonMeta` class is a metaclass used for implementing the Singleton design pattern in Python. The purpose of this metaclass is to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and shared among all the objects that need it.

The metaclass achieves this by keeping track of the instances created for each class that uses it. It maintains a dictionary called `_instances`, which maps each class to its instance. When an instance is requested, the metaclass first checks if an instance of the class already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If so, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance, adds it to the dictionary, and returns it.

By using the `SingletonMeta` metaclass, classes can be designed to have a single shared instance, ensuring that any modifications made to that instance are visible to all objects that use it.

This class does not have any dependencies.
