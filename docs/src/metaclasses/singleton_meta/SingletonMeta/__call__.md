## `__call__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> cls._instances[cls]`

#### Description:
This method is used to create and return a single instance of the class. It checks if the class is already in the `_instances` dictionary, and if not, it creates a new instance using the superclass's `__call__` method. It then stores the new instance in the `_instances` dictionary and returns it.

#### Parameters:
- `cls` (class): The class object itself.

#### Returns:
- `cls._instances[cls]` (class instance): The single instance of the class.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Create a single instance of the class
instance1 = SingletonMeta()
print(instance1)

# Create another instance, but receive the same instance as before
instance2 = SingletonMeta()
print(instance2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method checks if the class is already in the `_instances` dictionary by using the class object as the key. If it is not found, it creates a new instance of the class using the superclass's `__call__` method, which is the `__init__` method. It then stores the new instance in the `_instances` dictionary with the class object as the key. Finally, it returns the single instance of the class.

#### Dependencies:
- This method does not have any dependencies.
