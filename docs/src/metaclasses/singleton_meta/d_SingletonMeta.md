## `SingletonMeta`

#### Description:
This class represents a metaclass for creating singleton classes. A singleton class is a class that can only have one instance throughout the entire program. This metaclass ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a way to access that instance.

#### Attributes:
- `_instances` (`dict`): A dictionary that stores the instances of the singleton classes. The keys are the class names and the values are the instances of the classes.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of using the SingletonMeta metaclass
class MySingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

instance = MySingletonClass()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass is used as a metaclass for creating singleton classes. When a class is defined with `metaclass=SingletonMeta`, the metaclass is responsible for creating the class and ensuring that only one instance of the class is created.

The `SingletonMeta` class maintains a dictionary `_instances` that stores the instances of the singleton classes. When a new instance of a singleton class is created, the metaclass checks if an instance of that class already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If an instance exists, the existing instance is returned. If no instance exists, a new instance is created and stored in the `_instances` dictionary.

The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of each singleton class is created and provides a way to access that instance.

#### Dependencies:
This class does not have any dependencies.
