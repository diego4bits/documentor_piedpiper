## `exists_doc_log() -> bool`

#### Description:
This method checks if the file "doc.log" exists in the current Git repository. It belongs to the class `DocLog`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not have any parameters.

#### Returns:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the file "doc.log" exists in the current Git repository, otherwise returns `False`.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = exists_doc_log()
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = exists_doc_log()
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
- The method first creates a `Path` object called `desired_path` representing the file "doc.log" in the current directory.
- It then tries to select the most recent commit using the `GitManager.select_front_commit()` method.
- Next, it retrieves the Git object for the `desired_path` file using the `GitRetrieaver.get_file_git_object()` method.
- If both operations are successful, it returns `True` indicating that the file "doc.log" exists in the current Git repository.
- If any exception occurs during the process, it returns `False`.

#### Dependencies:
- `Path`: Represents a path to a file or directory in the file system.
- `GitManager`: Manages Git operations for the current repository.
- `GitRetrieaver`: Retrieves Git objects from the repository.
- This method relies on the existence of a Git repository and the availability of the file "doc.log" within that repository.
