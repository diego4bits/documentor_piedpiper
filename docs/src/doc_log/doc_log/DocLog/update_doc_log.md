## `update_doc_log(snippets_to_doc: SnippetStorage, snippets_to_delete: SnippetStorage) -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs the task of updating the document log. It is used to create a new log entry with information about the current commit, the number of snippets to document, and the number of snippets to delete. This method belongs to the class `DocLog`.

#### Parameters:
- `snippets_to_doc` (`SnippetStorage`): The storage object containing the snippets to be documented.
- `snippets_to_delete` (`SnippetStorage`): The storage object containing the snippets to be deleted.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return any value.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
update_doc_log(snippets_to_doc, snippets_to_delete)
```

#### How it Works:

The method first calls the `create_doc_log()` method of the `DocLog` class to create a new log entry. It then retrieves the number of snippets to document and the number of snippets to delete by getting the length of the `snippets_to_doc` and `snippets_to_delete` storage objects, respectively.

Next, it retrieves the short ID of the head commit using the `head_commit()` method of the `GitManager` class and assigns it to the `head_commit_hash` variable.

A new log message is created using the `dedent()` function, which formats the message by removing any common leading whitespace from each line. The log message includes the commit hash, the number of snippets to document, and the number of snippets to delete.

The method then gets the path of the document log file using the `get_doc_log_path()` method of the `DocLog` class and assigns it to the `doc_log_path` variable.

The content of the original log file is read using the `read_text()` method of the `Path` class and assigned to the `original_log_content` variable.

Finally, the new log message is prepended to the original log content, and the updated log content is written back to the document log file using the `write_text()` method of the `Path` class.

#### Dependencies:
- `SnippetStorage`: A storage object used to store snippets.
- `DocLog`: A class that provides methods for managing the document log.
- `GitManager`: A class that provides methods for managing Git operations.
- `dedent` from `textwrap`: A function used to format the log message by removing common leading whitespace.
- `Path` from `pathlib`: A class used to manipulate file paths and perform file operations.
