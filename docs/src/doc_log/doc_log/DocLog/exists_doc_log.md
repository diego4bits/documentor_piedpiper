## `exists_doc_log() -> bool`

#### Description:
This method checks if the file "doc.log" exists in the git repository. It belongs to the class `DocLog`.

#### Parameters:

#### Returns:

result = exists_doc_log()
print(result)
```

#### How it Works:

1. Sets the desired file path as "./doc.log".
2. Tries to select the latest commit from the front of the git repository using `GitManager.select_front_commit()`.
3. Tries to get the file object of the desired path from the git repository using `GitRetrieaver.get_file_git_object(desired_path)`.
4. If both steps 2 and 3 are successful, returns `True` indicating that the file "doc.log" exists in the git repository.
5. If any of the steps 2 or 3 fails, returns `False` indicating that the file "doc.log" does not exist in the git repository.

#### Dependencies:
- `GitManager`: Manages git operations.
- `GitRetrieaver`: Retrieves git objects.
