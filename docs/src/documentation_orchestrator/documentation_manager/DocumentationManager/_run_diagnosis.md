#### How it Works:
The method `_run_diagnosis` performs the following steps:
1. Updates the list of changed files in the Git repository using the `GitFileChecker.update_changed_files()` method.
2. Checks for any newly added files and updates the documentation accordingly using the `AddedFilesManager.check_added_files()` method.
3. Checks for any modified files and updates the documentation accordingly using the `ModifiedFilesManager.check_modified_files()` method.
4. Updates the snippets in the documentation to reflect the changes made to the code using the `_update_snippets_to_doc()` method of the `DocumentationManager` instance.
5. Updates the snippets to be deleted in the documentation based on the changes made to the code using the `_update_snippets_to_delete()` method of the `DocumentationManager` instance.
6. Updates the files to be deleted in the documentation based on the changes made to the code using the `_update_files_to_delete()` method of the `DocumentationManager` instance.
7. Updates the documentation log using the `update_doc_log()` method of the `DocumentationManager` class.
