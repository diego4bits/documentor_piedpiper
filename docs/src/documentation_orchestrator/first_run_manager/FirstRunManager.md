## `FirstRunManager`

#### Description:
This class represents a manager for handling the first run of a specific process or system. It provides functionalities for managing and scrapping files, as well as storing and retrieving snippets of code.

#### Attributes:
- `instance` (`ClassVar`): A class variable used to store the instance of the `FirstRunManager` class. This attribute is used to ensure that only one instance of the class is created. Default: `None`.
- `_snippets_to_doc` (`SnippetStorage`): An instance of the `SnippetStorage` class used for storing and retrieving code snippets. This attribute is used for managing the snippets during the first run. 
- `_first_run_scrapper` (`FileScrapper`): An instance of the `FileScrapper` class used for scrapping files during the first run. This attribute is used to retrieve information from the files and store them in the `SnippetStorage` instance.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = FirstRunManager()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `FirstRunManager` class works by providing functionalities to manage the first run of a process or system. It utilizes the `SnippetStorage` class to store and retrieve code snippets, and the `FileScrapper` class to scrape files during the first run. The class ensures that only one instance is created using the `instance` class variable.

#### Dependencies:
- `SnippetStorage`: A class used for storing and retrieving code snippets.
- `FileScrapper`: A class used for scrapping files.

Note: The class may have additional dependencies based on the methods and logic implemented in the class. However, without further information, these dependencies cannot be determined.
