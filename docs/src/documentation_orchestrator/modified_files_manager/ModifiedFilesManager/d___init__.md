## `__init__() -> None`

#### Description:
This method initializes an instance of the `ModifiedFilesManager` class. It creates instances of `FileScrapper`, `SnippetStorage`, and dictionaries to store old deleted snippets, new added snippets, and modified snippets.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return any value.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not raise any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Initializing an instance of ModifiedFilesManager
manager = ModifiedFilesManager()
```

#### How it Works:
The `__init__` method creates instances of `FileScrapper` for both the front and tail files. It also creates instances of `SnippetStorage` to store snippets that need to be documented and snippets that need to be deleted. Additionally, it initializes dictionaries to store old deleted snippets, new added snippets, and modified snippets.

#### Dependencies:
- `FileScrapper`: This class is responsible for scraping files.
- `SnippetStorage`: This class is responsible for storing code snippets.
