## `_check_modified_files() -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs a series of actions to check for modified files and update the necessary data structures. It belongs to the class `ModifiedFilesManager`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return anything (`None`).

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
manager = ModifiedFilesManager()
manager._check_modified_files()

# Another use case (if applicable)
...
```

#### How it Works:
1. Checks if there are any modified files using the `GitFileChecker.modified` attribute.
2. If there are modified files:
    - Calls the `_start_file_scrappers()` method to initiate the file scrapers.
    - Calls the `_update_all_snippets_dict()` method to update the dictionary of all code snippets.
    - Calls the `_update_snippets_to_doc()` method to update the snippets that need to be documented.
    - Calls the `_update_snippets_to_delete()` method to update the snippets that need to be deleted.
