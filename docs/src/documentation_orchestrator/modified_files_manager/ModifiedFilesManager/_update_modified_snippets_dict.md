## `_update_modified_snippets_dict() -> None`

#### Description:
This method updates the `_modified_snippets_dict` attribute of the `ModifiedFilesManager` class with the snippets that have been modified in both the front and tail files. It compares the implementation of the snippets in the front and tail files and adds them to the `_modified_snippets_dict` if they differ. This method belongs to the class `ModifiedFilesManager`.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return any value.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
manager = ModifiedFilesManager()
manager._update_modified_snippets_dict()
```

#### How it Works:
1. Get the keys of the snippets stored in the `storage_dict` of the `file_scrapper_front` and `file_scrapper_tail` instances.
2. Find the intersection of the front and tail snippets' keys.
3. Create an empty dictionary `modified_snippets_dict` to store the modified snippets.
4. Iterate over the intersection of snippet keys.
5. Get the front and tail snippets using the hash integer.
6. Compare the implementation of the front and tail snippets.
7. If the implementation differs, add the front snippet to the `modified_snippets_dict` using the hash integer as the key.
8. Update the `_modified_snippets_dict` attribute of the `ModifiedFilesManager` instance with the `modified_snippets_dict`.

#### Dependencies:
- `file_scrapper_front` (FileScrapper): An instance of the `FileScrapper` class used to scrape snippets from the front file.
- `file_scrapper_tail` (FileScrapper): An instance of the `FileScrapper` class used to scrape snippets from the tail file.
- `CodeSnippet` (class): A class representing a code snippet.
