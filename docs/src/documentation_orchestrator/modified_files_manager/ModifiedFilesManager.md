## `ModifiedFilesManager`

#### Description:
This class represents a manager for modified files. It provides functionalities for managing and tracking modified files, as well as their snippets.

#### Attributes:
- `instance` (`ClassVar`) : A class variable that holds the instance of the class. Default: `None`.
- `_file_scrapper_tail` (`FileScrapper`): An instance of the `FileScrapper` class used for scraping the tail of modified files.
- `_file_scrapper_front` (`FileScrapper`): An instance of the `FileScrapper` class used for scraping the front of modified files.
- `_snippets_to_doc` (`SnippetStorage`): An instance of the `SnippetStorage` class used for storing snippets that need to be documented.
- `_snippets_to_delete` (`SnippetStorage`): An instance of the `SnippetStorage` class used for storing snippets that need to be deleted.
- `_old_deleted_snippets_dict` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): A dictionary that stores the old deleted snippets, where the key is the snippet ID and the value is an instance of the `CodeSnippet` class.
- `_new_added_snippets_dict` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): A dictionary that stores the new added snippets, where the key is the snippet ID and the value is an instance of the `CodeSnippet` class.
- `_modified_snippets_dict` (`Dict[int, CodeSnippet]`): A dictionary that stores the modified snippets, where the key is the snippet ID and the value is an instance of the `CodeSnippet` class.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = ModifiedFilesManager()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `ModifiedFilesManager` class is responsible for managing and tracking modified files and their snippets. It utilizes instances of the `FileScrapper`, `SnippetStorage`, and `CodeSnippet` classes for various operations. The class maintains dictionaries to store different types of snippets, including those to be documented, deleted, and modified. The class also uses class variables to keep track of the instance of the class.
